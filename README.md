# Project Manzar 🛰️  

**Manzar (منظر)** is an Arabic word meaning *"a view, a scene, or a spectacle."*  

This project is built on that idea: pulling back the curtain of time and giving you a direct view of any location on Earth as seen from orbit.  

`manzar` is a **command-line tool** to capture the ever-changing scene of our planet — helping you witness how our world transforms from space.  


## ✨ Features  
- View satellite imagery for any location on Earth  
- Compare changes over time  
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface  
- Brings the *"Manzar"* — the scene — directly to you
